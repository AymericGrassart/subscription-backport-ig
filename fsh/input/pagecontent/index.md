The Subscription R5 Backport Implementation Guide enables servers running verions of FHIR earlier than R5 to implement a subset of R5 Subscriptions in a standardized way.

## About This Guide

This is a draft implementation guide to enable the implementation of R5-style subscriptions in earlier versions of FHIR.

The goal of publishing this guide is to define a standard method of back-porting newer subscriptions for greater compatibility and adoption.
